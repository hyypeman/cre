        Analyze all available data sources and provide:
        
        1. PRIMARY OWNERSHIP INFORMATION
           - The most likely current legal owner of the property
           - Whether the owner is an LLC, corporation, or individual
           - Your confidence level in this determination
           - If the owner is an LLC or corporation, identify the company name
        
        2. INDIVIDUAL OWNERS/CONTACTS
           - Identify all individual owners/contacts associated with this property from all sources
           - For each individual owner/contact identified, provide:
             * name: Their full name
             * source: Where you found this person (PropertyShark, ACRIS, ZoLa, etc.)
             * type: Their role (owner, manager, member, etc.)
           - Determine if we have any individual owners identified (true/false)
        
        3. CONTACT INFORMATION
           - Contact names associated with the property (up to 4)
           - Phone numbers associated with the property or contacts (up to 6)
           - Email addresses associated with the property or contacts (up to 4)
           - The primary phone number (the most reliable one)
        
        4. NOTES AND CONTEXT
           - Provide any observations, explanations, or additional context about the data
        
        # IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS
        
        - PropertyShark and ACRIS are reliable sources for ownership information
        - PropertyShark's "real_owners" data is good for contact information
        - Consider all sources when identifying individual owners
        - Look for real people associated with LLCs or corporations
        - Format phone numbers as (XXX) XXX-XXXX if possible
        - HIGH confidence: When data matches across multiple sources
        - MEDIUM confidence: When data is from reliable source but not confirmed by others
        - LOW confidence: When sources conflict or limited data is available
        - The goal is to identify all possible individual contacts for this property
