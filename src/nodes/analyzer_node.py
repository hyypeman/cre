        # TASK
        Analyze all available data sources and extract the following information:
        
        1. The most likely current legal owner of the property
        2. Whether the owner is an LLC, corporation, or individual
        3. Your confidence level in this determination
        4. Up to 4 contact names associated with the property
        5. Up to 6 phone numbers associated with the property or contacts
        6. Up to 4 email addresses associated with the property or contacts
        7. The primary phone number (the most reliable one)
        8. Any observations or explanations about the data in the notes field
        
        # PRIORITY RULES
        - PropertyShark's "registered_owners" data is the most reliable source for ownership
        - Recent deed documents from ACRIS are the next most reliable for ownership
        - PropertyShark's "real_owners" data is good for contact information
        - Phone numbers should be formatted as (XXX) XXX-XXXX if possible
        - If the owner is an LLC or corporation, list it as the company
        - If the owner is an individual, leave the company field empty
        
        # CONFIDENCE DETERMINATION
        - HIGH confidence: When PropertyShark data matches with ACRIS and/or ZoLa data
        - MEDIUM confidence: When only PropertyShark data is available, or when there are minor discrepancies between sources
        - LOW confidence: When sources conflict significantly or when limited data is available
        
        # IMPORTANT
        Include any explanations, observations, or additional context in the notes field.
